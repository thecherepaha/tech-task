🚀 TypeScript Express API with Knex and Module Aliases

📝 Project Overview
This is a TypeScript-based Express API server with Knex.js for database interactions and module-alias for simplified imports. It includes configurations for development with ts-node-dev and production-ready TypeScript builds. The project is structured following a clean MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and has dynamic filtering and pagination capabilities.

🛠️ Installation
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.

bash
Копировать код
# Check Node.js version
node -v

# Check npm version
npm -v
Clone the Repository
bash
Копировать код
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install Dependencies
bash
Копировать код
npm install
🚀 Getting Started
Running in Development
To start the server in development mode with automatic restarts on file changes, run:

bash
Копировать код
npm run dev
This will use ts-node-dev to run the TypeScript code without the need for manual transpiling.

Running Migrations
Make sure your database is configured and run the latest migrations using Knex:

bash
Копировать код
npm run migrate
Building for Production
To build the TypeScript code and run it with Node.js:

bash
Копировать код
npm run production
This will transpile TypeScript files into JavaScript in the dist/ folder and then run the server from dist/server.js.

📖 API Endpoints
Base URL: /api
GET /cars: Fetch a list of cars with filtering and pagination.

Parameters: brand, model, year, limit, offset, search
POST /car: Create a new car entry.

Body (JSON):
json
Копировать код
{
  "brand": "Audi",
  "model": "A4",
  "year": 2022,
  "color": "Black",
  "vin": "1234567890ABCDEF1"
}
Other endpoints: You can define more routes as your project grows!

🛠️ Technologies & Tools
TypeScript: Strongly typed language for safer code.
Express: Fast and minimal web framework for Node.js.
Knex.js: SQL query builder for interacting with databases.
Module Aliases: Simplified import paths for a cleaner codebase.
Nodemon: Automatically restarts the server during development.
ts-node-dev: Hot-reload and fast TypeScript compilation.
dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file.
📜 Environment Variables
Make sure to define your environment variables in a .env file at the root of the project:

makefile

DB_CLIENT=pg
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=your_db_name
DB_PORT=5432
